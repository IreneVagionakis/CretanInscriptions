Cretan Institutional Inscriptions
====

The database **Cretan Institutional Inscriptions** was created by Irene Vagionakis as part of her PhD research project 
at the University of Venice Caâ€™ Foscari (2016-2019; supervisors: Claudia Antonetti and Gabriel Bodard). 
The database, built by using the **EpiDoc Front-End Services (EFES)** platform, collects the EpiDoc editions of 
600 inscriptions shedding light on the institutions of the political entities of Crete from the VII to the I century BC.


EFES: EpiDoc Front-End Services
====

**EpiDoc Front-End Services (EFES)** is a free, easy to use, highly customisable platform for the online 
publication of ancient texts in EpiDoc XML. EFES allows the creation of multiple indices, search and browse 
interface, geographical visualisation, and integration with linked open data.

EFES is a fork of **Kiln**, an open source multi-platform framework for building 
and deploying complex websites whose source content is primarily in XML.
