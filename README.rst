Cretan Institutional Inscriptions
====

The database **Cretan Institutional Inscriptions** was created by Irene Vagionakis as part of her PhD research project 
at the University of Venice Caâ€™ Foscari (2016-2019; supervisors: Claudia Antonetti and Gabriel Bodard). 
The database, built by using the **EpiDoc Front-End Services (EFES)** platform, collects the EpiDoc editions of 
600 inscriptions shedding light on the institutions of the political entities of Crete from the VII to the I century BC.
